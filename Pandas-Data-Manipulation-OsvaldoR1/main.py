# Step 1: Use the appropriate pandas method to read the titanic data into your python file 
titanic_data = pandas.read_csv('titanic.csv')

# Step 2(a): Use the pandas method that reads the first 25 lines of the dataset
first_25_passengers = titanic_data.iloc[1:25]

# Step 2(b): Use the pandas method thats reads the last 25 lines of the dataset
last_25_passengers = titanic_data.iloc[867:892]

# Step 3: Use the pandas method that only tells us the number of rows and columns in our data
titanic_shape = titanic_data.shape 

# Step 4: Describe the titanic data
titanic_description = titanic_data.describe()

# Step 5(a): How many passengers were between the ages of 0 to 16? 
children = titanic_data[titanic_data['Age'] <= 16]

# Step 5(b): How many passengers were between the ages of 17 to 25?
young_adults = titanic_data[(titanic_data['Age'] >= 17) & (titanic_data['Age'] <= 25)]

# Step 5(c): How many passengers were between the ages of 26 to 40?
adults = titanic_data[(titanic_data['Age'] >= 26) & (titanic_data['Age'] <= 40)]

# Step 5(d): How many passengers were between the ages of 41 to 59?
mature_adults = titanic_data[(titanic_data['Age'] >= 41) & (titanic_data['Age'] <= 59)]

# Step 5(e): How many passengers were 60 or older?
seniors = titanic_data[titanic_data['Age'] >= 60]

# Step 6: How many values are missing from the "age" column
missing_ages = titanic_data['Age'].count()

# Step 7: List out all the available passengers' ages
age_list = titanic_data.sort_values(by='Age')

# Step 8: Filter the DataFrame to find all passengers who boarded the Titanic at Port Cherbourg
cherbourg_passengers = titanic_data[titanic_data['Embarked'] == 'C' ]

# Step 9(a): Find the average age of all female passengers
avg_fem_age = titanic_data[titanic_data['Sex'] == 'Female' ].mean()

# Step 9(b): Find the average age of all male passengers
avg_male_age = titanic_data[titanic_data['Sex'] == 'Male' ].mean()

# Step 10(a): Find the survival percentage of passengers in group "C"
cherbourg_survival = titanic_data[titanic_data['Cabin'] == 'C' ].mean()

# Step 10(b): Find the survival percentage of passengers in group "Q"
queenstown_survival = titanic_data[titanic_data['Cabin'] == 'Q' ].mean()

# Step 10(c): Find the survival percentage of passengers in group "S"
south_survival = titanic_data[titanic_data['Cabin'] == 'S' ].mean()
