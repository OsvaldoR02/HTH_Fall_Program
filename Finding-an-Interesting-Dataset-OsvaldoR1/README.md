I chose this data because I've always been into soccer my whole life and on top of that there is a game about something I love so it caught my interest. I used to play fifa as a little kid on my phone since i didn't have a console to play on and recently I was able to play fifa 22 and enjoy it in a different game. Once I saw that there was a data set for fifa I immediately knew that this was going to be my data. Once i knew this was going to be my data i noticed that i have many questions that i would like to answer using thai data as i did play the game before the new fifa came out.
